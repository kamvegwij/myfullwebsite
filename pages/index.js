                  Queenstown, Eastern Cape South Africa.
                  I am a Full Stack Developer and Game Developer with a passion for learning new technologies and applying them practically.
                  I have strong leadership qualities as I served as the chairman and club captain for the UWC Tennis Club and for the final year project I took the initiative to 
                  make sure the team stayed on track and met the constant deadlines. I work well in a team and as a practical learner I enjoy socialising with other people
                  and coming up with new ways of solving problems.

              <p>I'm a young and enthusiastic developer and I'm ready to challenge myself by aquiring more skills and knowledge in the
                 field of Software Development. #ADAPT, through this assignment I forced myself to step out
                 of my comfort zone and create something new from scratch in a short span of time. I truly believe in thinking different and allowing myself to 
                 take up unfamiliar technologies as this in turn makes me grow greatly as a developer and overall as a person because accomplishing something I 
                 had little to no prior knowledge is a great source of motivation for any future project.
                 With all this being said I believe I would make a great team member at SovTech and showcase my talent and potential.
